# MeetingMuncher

MeetingMuncher is a CLI tool designed for the efficient transcription and analysis of meeting audio. It leverages the power of OpenAI's APIs to transcribe audio content, summarize discussions, extract key points, identify action items, and analyze sentiment.

It can work directly with YouTube videos, using pytube package, or it can use mp4 files.

For google meets, please, download first the mp4 file, and later use that as the second parameter to meeting_minutes.py

## Usage

    ```sh
    python3 meeting_minutes.py $OPENAI_API_KEY path_to_your_video_file.mp4


    ```sh
    python3 meeting_minutes.py $OPENAI_API_KEY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5v3kku4y6Q


    Third parameter in CLI, sets the name for the temporary_file

    ```sh
    python3 meeting_minutes.py $OPENAI_API_KEY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5v3kku4y6Q


    finally it returns a docx and a json file within the downloads directory containing transcription details, title gets automatically generated by gpt.
